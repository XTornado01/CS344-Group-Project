If you want to do a review and you use the DB file in the folder, the user IDs are 1,2, or 3 (unless you manually add one to the DB), no password is necessary (the db login info is "root",""). If you have gone through a review for a project, it will be removed from the selection possiblities on the project selection section(unless you manually delete them). Remember that a new record is created in review and answer everytime you submit a review (go through each page to the end). Don't forget that this will need to be loaded into the live directory of your PHP server, if you are using XAMPP, then you will need to have this in your htdocs folder and use localhost.
